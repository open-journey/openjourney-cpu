# Run OpenJourney on CPU

The script provided in this particular repository is for users who have no GPU or have small amounts of GPU VRAM available. Please note that this process takes a very, very long time to generate images but still is better than nothing 😁

## Dependencies 

1. Install `pytorch`

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
